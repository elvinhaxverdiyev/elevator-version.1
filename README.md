🏢 Elevator Simulation Program
This project is a Python-based Elevator Simulation. The program starts the elevator on a random floor, picks up a passenger, and transports them to their target floor. 🚶‍♂️🔼🔽

📌 Features
🚪 Opening and Closing Doors
🏢 Moving Between Different Floors
🧍 Passenger Entering and Exiting the Elevator
🔄 Elevator Moving According to Passenger’s Target Floor
🎲 Elevator Starts on a Random Floor

📂 File Structure
📜 elevator.py - Controls elevator movement
🚶‍♂️ person.py - Creates the passenger object
📝 move_text.py - Stores elevator movement messages
🏗 main.py - Main execution file

🔹 How It Works
The elevator starts on a random floor.
A passenger calls the elevator from a certain floor.
The elevator picks up the passenger and takes them to their target floor.
The movement process is displayed in real-time.

⚠️ Possible Errors and Solutions
❌ Modules Not Found:
Ensure the file names are correct.
